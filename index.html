			<section class="Beef">
				<h2>Beef</h2>
				<p>There’s a reason beef has a regular place in our weekly meal plans. Several reasons, actually. Beef is an incredibly versatile and affordable option (depending on how you shop) that can be cooked into many different types of dinners. We all know ground beef can be easily turned into dozens of recipes, including burgers or meatloaf, stir-fries, and casseroles. If a meaty steak is what you’re after, it’s surprisingly fast to cook up on the stovetop. And large, tough cuts of beef, like a top round or chuck roast, are ideal for slow roasts and stews (preferably in the slow cooker or Instant Pot).</p>
